# Dummy Script for n8n workflows
Since there is lots of limitation in n8n, I am using this script to do some workarounds. Beware that the python package under n8n is limited. 

Please refer to the [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/#python) for more information.

And Read the Pyodide for more details:
